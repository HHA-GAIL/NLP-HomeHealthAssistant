ConvertToDLL.cmd is used to convert jars to dlls.
The jars should be compiled in jdk1.7.
And here we need all the dlls generated in DLLs.
Each time if the jars are changed, the ConvertToDLL.cmd should be runned. And you can modify the content if it is needed.
And to run this command, you should install ikvm first and set the environment path.
